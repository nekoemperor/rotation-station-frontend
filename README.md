## Off-Platform Project: Gritty Rotation Station (from CodeCademy)

In this project, I built a simple website with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

### This website's features:

1. Make rotation to the mascot (left or right)
2. Trigger an event when a user hovers over an element on the site
3. Create a new element (text) & image next to it, then attach it to the DOM

## The Website
