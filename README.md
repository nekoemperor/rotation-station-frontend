## Off-Platform Project: Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts (from CodeCademy)

In this project, I built a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on my own computer.

### At a high-level, this project will require the following:

1. A folder structure that makes sense for the project
2. An HTML file
3. A CSS file

### To successfully complete the project, youâ€™ll require the following images:
